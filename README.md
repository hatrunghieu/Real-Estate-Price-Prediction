# Bangalore Home Price Prediction

This project is a web application for predicting home prices in Bangalore, India. It's built as a learning exercise to demonstrate a full-stack data science project, from data cleaning and model training to deploying a web interface.

## Features

* **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**: Handles missing values, converts data types, and creates new features like `bhk` (Bedrooms Hall Kitchen) and `price_per_sqft` for better model performance.
* **Outlier Detection & Removal**: Implements business logic (e.g., minimum 300 sqft per BHK) and statistical methods (mean and one standard deviation per location) to identify and remove outliers from `price_per_sqft`. It also removes properties where the number of bathrooms is unusually high compared to BHK (e.g., more than `bhk + 1`).
* **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduces the number of categorical features (locations) by tagging locations with less than 10 data points as "other" to minimize dummy columns during one-hot encoding.
* **Model Training**: Trains a Linear Regression model for price prediction.
* **Model Evaluation**: Uses K-Fold Cross-Validation (`ShuffleSplit`) to assess model accuracy, showing scores consistently above 80%. It also uses `GridSearchCV` to compare Linear Regression, Lasso, and Decision Tree Regressor models, confirming Linear Regression as the best performer.
* **Web Application**: Provides a simple user interface to get estimated home prices based on user inputs for area, number of bedrooms (BHK), bathrooms, and location.

## Technologies Used

* **Python**: For data processing, model training, and backend API.
    * `pandas`
    * `numpy`
    * `scikit-learn`
    * `matplotlib`
    * `Flask`
* **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For the frontend web application.
    * `jQuery`

## Project Structure

* `banglore_home_prices_final.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training steps. This notebook exports the trained model and column information as artifacts.
* `utils.py`: A Python utility module that handles loading the saved model artifacts (`columns.json` and `banglore_home_prices_model.pickle`) and provides a `get_estimated_price` function for price prediction and `get_location_names` for fetching location data.
* `server.py`: A Flask application that sets up API endpoints, including `/get_location_names` to fetch available locations and `/predict_home_price` to receive user input and return estimated prices.
* `app.html`: The main HTML file for the web interface, allowing users to input property details and see price estimates.
* `app.css`: The CSS file that defines the styling and layout of the web application.
* `app.js`: The JavaScript file that handles client-side logic, including fetching location names, collecting user input, sending requests to the Flask backend, and displaying the estimated price.
* `server/artifacts/`: This directory is intended to store the trained `banglore_home_prices_model.pickle` and `columns.json` files, which are generated by the Jupyter notebook after model training.

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd bangalore-home-price-prediction
    ```
2.  **Set up the Python environment:**
    It is recommended to create a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    conda create -n dl python=3.13.3 # Or your preferred Python version
    conda activate dl
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib Flask # Install necessary libraries
    ```
3.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    Open `banglore_home_prices_final.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook. Run all cells in the notebook. This step will perform data preprocessing, train the machine learning model, and save the model (`banglore_home_prices_model.pickle`) and column data (`columns.json`) into the `server/artifacts` directory.
4.  **Start the Flask server:**
    Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and execute:
    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```
    The server will typically start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
5.  **Open the web application:**
    Open the `app.html` file in your web browser. This will load the frontend interface, which then communicates with the running Flask backend for predictions.

**Note:** For the price estimation functionality to work correctly, the Flask backend server (`server.py`) must be running before you open `app.html` in your browser.
